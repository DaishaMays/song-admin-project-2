  With advancements in technology there has been a signficant rise in independent and freelance music creators. Most artists are just having fun, sharing their music and there is limited knowledge about how to properly publish your music and collect all of your royalties. What information do companies like BMI, Distrokid and many others need and how many times will you have to fill out the information over and over again. In comes Soundtrackam! Soundtrackam is a database that stores all of your significant song publishing information in one place saving you the headache of having to peice all of that information together everytime you want to release a song.
